## Development

The project uses:
- Vanilla JavaScript for front-end functionality
- Python with SQLite for back-end services
- Custom CSS animations and transitions
- OCR-A and BW Stretch fonts for typography

## Database Management

The application uses SQLite for data storage. While database files are not version controlled, we maintain database integrity through:

1. Schema Version Control:
   - Database structure is defined in `schema.sql`
   - Run `sqlite3 scattergraph.db < schema.sql` to initialize the database

2. Backup System:
   - Use `python3 backup_db.py` to create timestamped backups
   - Backups include both .db file copies and SQL dumps
   - Backup files are stored in the `backups/` directory
